# Refactorings for Architectural Alignment 
_(Meeting Protocol)_

1. Flatten `/request/handler` to `/handler`. Retain `/description` subpackage (seemingly minor but this created a lot of confusion).
2. Rename `/http` to `/message` (minor, but easy to do)
3. Remove ConfigurationProvider and its implementations; replace with fail-fast POJOs that are specific to each requiring service. Remove this interface from `ids.spi`.
4. Remove all other classes in `ids.spi.version`. There should be one version type (not separate inbound/outbound) and that should be explicitly set as a code constant, not obtained
   from an artifact assumed to be on the classpath or in a manifest.
5. Remove `RejectionMultipartRequestHandler` and `RejectionMessageFactory`
6. Remove `DescriptionRequestMessageHandlerRegistry` and handle dispatching to Sub Handlers directly in `DescriptionRequestHandler`.
7. Remove `ResourceCatalogFactory` and place any logic in the `ConnectorDescriptionService`. If this logic needs to be factored out in the future, create another class and pass it
   to the ctor.
8. Ditto for `DescriptionResponseMessageFactory`.
9. Ditto for `BaseConnectorFactory` and remove one line methods.

## Discussion Points

1. IdsId type is complicated and seems to do multiple things.

   a. IdsId parse(String urn) - Can that be moved to the Description sub handler for dispatching? Also, just take the URI, get the scheme-specific part and tokenize it. Don't
   convert to string first.
   b. The enum type does not appear to offer any value if the `DescriptionRequestHandler` handles dispatching to sub handlers.  
   c. The id methods should be removed and handled by a `IdsTypeTransformer`.
   
2. Method `handle(DescriptionRequestMessage descriptionRequestMessage, String payload)` - Why is payload a string, should it be a type (e.g. a materialized type or Void)? - Leave as string for now.


## Other

1. `gradle.properties` should not be in ids-api-multipart-endpoint-v1 - there is one properties file with the IDS InfoModel version in it in the root project (easy to do)
2. Create an interface for `ConnectorDescriptionService`
3. `ContractOffer` should use Unix Epoch longs instead of `ZonedDateTime`
4. Security Profile should default to `NONE`
5. `ConnectorDescriptionRequestHandler` should not return a null MultipartResponse:
   ```java
   if (!isRequestingCurrentConnectorsDescription(descriptionRequestMessage)) {
       return null;
   }
   ```
